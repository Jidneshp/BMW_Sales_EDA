# BMW Sales EDA 🚗📊😏

Welcome to the next-level (arguably overkill?) Exploratory Data Analysis on BMW Sales Data (2010-2024). Yes, we analyzed 50,000 rows across 11 columns. If only BMW paid us per chart, we'd be buying one, not analyzing them.

## What's inside?
- **No missing values** (so no excuses).
- **Stats you didn't ask for:** mean price $75,034, max mileage 199,996 km, and enough engine sizes to make a mechanic dizzy.
- **Regions fight to the death for the highest sales. Spoiler: Asia and North America punch above their weight.**
- **Main message:** If you owned a red manual petrol BMW in 2016, congrats, you are the dataset's chosen one. 
- **From 2012 onwards, EVs dominate the sales charts, making petrol heads cry and electric fans smug.**

## Funniest Insight
- Electric BMWs (2012+) outsell the rest, proving that saving the planet is the hot new luxury flex.

## Sarcasm Section
- Why do an EDA this big? Because we can. And because Excel crashed at row 49,999. 

## Most Surprising Stat
- There's a 1.5L BMW engine someone actually bought. Legends walk among us.
