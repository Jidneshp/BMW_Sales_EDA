# BMW_Sales_EDA

## Project Overview
This repository features an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of BMW vehicle sales data covering 2010-2024. The analysis focuses on identifying sales trends, patterns, and relevant statistics across models, regions, and vehicle features.
If only BMW paid us per chart, we'd be buying one, not analyzing them.

## Key Insights
- **Electric vehicles have led BMW sales almost every year since 2012.**
- Regions with the highest sales: Asia and North America.
- Mean BMW sale price: $75,034, with max at $119,998.
- Highest mileage recorded: 199,996 km.

## Usage
Run the EDA notebook to view analyses, statistics, and visualizations. The code uses pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.
